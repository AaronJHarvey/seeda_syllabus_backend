## Routes

- Why namespaces routes?
    - Since, eventually, our frontend application might be hosted on a specific domain i.e. `http://seeda.com`, we will want all of our backend routes to be _namespaced_ **to indicate they are routes associated with the API**.
    - Example Index Route: `http://seeda.com/api/v1/syllabuses`
- In `config/routes.rb` we'll define the routes as follows:
    ```ruby
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      namespace :api do
        namespace :v1 do
          resources :syllabuses, only: [:index]
        end
      end
    end
    ```

## Controllers

- How does namespaced routes impact the controller?
    - In your console run: `rails g controller api/v1/Syllabuses`
    - Notice that the controller file this created lives in `/app/controllers/api/v1/syllabuses_controller.rb` and the actual class name of the controller is _namespaced_ like `Api::V1::SyllabusController` as well.
- Review [docs](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#nested-resources) on nested resources in Rails

**Note on API Versioning:** This is the first version of our API. Therefore, the controller should go inside api/v1. If anyone is relying on our API and we update the code in a way that would break other people's projects, it's good practice to make that update its own version of the API. Read this if you want a deeper dive into api versioning.

**Example Syllabus Controller:**

```ruby
class Api::V1::SyllabusesController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @syllabuses = Syllabus.all
    render json: @syllabuses
  end

  def create
    @syllabus.new(syllabus_params)
    if @syllabus.save
      render json: @syllabus, status: :accepted
    else
      render json: { errors: @syllabus.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessible_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def syllabus_params
    params.permit(:title, :description, :image_url, :category_id)
  end

end
```

**A few things are happening in the above methods:**

1. We're rendering all syllabuses in the form of JSON.
2. We're creating a new syllabus based on whatever `syllabus_params` we get from our frontend.
3. We're setting out `syllabus_params` to permit a parameter named `title`, `description`, `image_url` and `category_id`. _These must be included in the body of the POST or PATCH requests we will be making with JS `fetch`._
4. We're setting the status based on the a successful `.save`. Check out the following links for more info on the [202 (Accepted)](https://httpstatuses.com/202) and [422 (Unprocessible Entity)](https://httpstatuses.com/422) status codes — along with other [`httpstatuses`](https://httpstatuses.com/) you can use in your methods.

## Serializers

#### Fast JSON API Intro

- Once `gem fast_jsonapi` is installed, you will gain access to a new generator, `serializer`.
- With these serializers, we can start to define information about each model and their _related_ models we want to share in our API.

**NOTE:** Serializers generated by the Fast JSON API gem have two built-in methods called `serializable_hash` and `serialized_json` which return a serialized hash and a JSON string respectively. However, we don't actually need either of these in this example, as `to_json` will still be called on `SightingSerializer.new(sighting)` implicitly. As we will see, once our serializers are configured and initialized, we will not need
to do any additional work

- When rendering JSON directly, controllers will render all attributes available by default. **Fast JSON API serializers work the other way around - we must always specify what attributes we want to include.**

**NOTE:* Having the [JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en-US) Chrome extension installed. This will make JSON data much easier to read.

#### Adding Relationships

**Serializer:**
```ruby
class SyllabusSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :title, :description, :image_url, :category_id
  belongs_to :category
end
```

**Controller:**
```ruby
class Api::V1::SyllabusesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @syllabuses = Syllabus.all
    options = {
      # include associated category
      include: [:category]
    }
    # pass options object to serializer
    render json: SyllabusSerializer.new(@syllabuses, options)
  end
end
```

#### Fast JSON API Conclusion

- _We do not get to choose exactly how data gets serialized_ the way we do when writing our own serializer classes, but we gain a lot of flexibility by using the Fast JSON API.
- Its conventions also allow it to work well even when dealing with a large number of related objects.
